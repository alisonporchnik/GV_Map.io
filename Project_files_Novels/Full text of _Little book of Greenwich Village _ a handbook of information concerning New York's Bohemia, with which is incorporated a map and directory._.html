Yet we are free who live in Washington 
Square, 

We dare to think as up-towncrs wouldn't 
dare, 

Blazing our nights with arguments up- 
roarious; 

What care we for dull old world cen- 
sorious, 

When each is sure he'll fashion something 
glorious?

APOLOGY 

Acknowledgments are due first of all to 
Arthur Moss, from whose intimate knowl- 
edge of Greenwich Village, past and pres- 
ent, I have drawn generously in gathering 
the material for* this book. He has also 
been good enough to allow the use of the 
map, taken from the portfolio "Green- 
wich Village, by Its Artists," published by 
him. My thanks also to Bobby Edwards 
for the use of his song, to John Reed for 
his poem, and to Floyd Dell for extracts 
frbm the Liberator. I have not hesitated 
to quote copiously from Thomas A. Jan- 
vier's In Old New York, Anna Alice 
Chapin's Greenwich Village, and from 
the booklet about Greenwich Village pub- 
lished by the People's Institute; therefore, 
to the author's of these books my acknowl- 
edgments. I also drew upon Arthur B. 
Maurice's New York of the Novelists for 
material. 

I have no doubt laid myself open to the 
most scathing criticism, as regards the 
names that have been included, or for that 
matter, excluded, frtom "Who's Who." My 
plea must be that I did my durndest, and 
angels kin do no more. Suggestions (in 
writing) for making a second edition more 
comprehensive will be welcomed.

PICTURESQUE INDIVIDUALITY 

Greenwich Village has always been to 
me the most attractive portion of New 
York. It has the positive individuality, the 
age, much of the picturesqueness of that 
fascinating region of which the center is 
Chatham Square. 

Greenwich owes its picturesqueness to 
the protecting spirit of gface which has 
saved its streets from being rectangular 
and its houses from being all alike; and 
which also has preserved its many quaint- 
nesses and beauties of age — with such re- 
sulting blessings as the view around the 
curve in Grove Street toward St. Luke's 
Church, or under the arch of trees where 
Grove and Christopher Streets, are mitred 
together by the little park, and the many 
friendly old houses, which stand squarely 
on their right to be individual and have 
their own opinion of the rows of modern 
dwellings all made of precisfely the same 
material cast in precisely the same mould. 
— Thomas A. Janvier in "In Old New 
York."

IN RETROSPECTION 

Almost a hundred years ago the fash- 
ionable folk of New York City used to 
drive two miles into the country to 
Greenwich Village, along the "Inland 
Road," traversing what is now Park Row, 
the Bowery and Waverly Place. The 
drive took them past a pauper graveyard 
often complained of as an unsightly spot, 
unworthy of so genteel and fashionable 
a driveway. That graveyard is now 
Washington Square, one of the most beau- 
tiful parks in New York City. But mod- 
ern New York still calls this territory 
south of 14th Street and west of Fifth 
Avenue by the old name, Greenwich 
Village. 

In 1822 an epidemic of yellow fever 
broke out in New York City, and a high 
board fence was stretched across the isl- 
and as a quarantine boundary. Green- 
wich Village, always considered particu- 
larly healthful, became a refuge from the 
fever-stricken city. Almost overnight the 
tiny village "sprouted into a town." In 
the haste of emergency building there was 
no time to straighten the village lanes and 
cowpaths and these rapidly became streets. 
Later the makeshift houses were replaced 
by substantial brick and stone structures. 
But the twists and curves of the streets 
were never changed. And when, finally, 
the city, growing to the north, met and 
annexed the village, the two communities 
had to fit together a c best they could. 

Thus it is that Fourth Street twists around 
until it crosses Tenth and Eleventh Streets, 
Waverly Place actually crosses itself, and 
every here and there two or three streets 
run in together at odd angles, forming a 
charming little three-cornered "square" to 
make the chance passer-by wonder if this 
can really be New York.

NOVELISTS' PARADISE 

A number of authors, feeling the charm 
of the Village, have woven it into their 
romances. Three of O. Henry's stories 
have Greenwich Village for background. 
The phenomenon of Waverly Place "cross- 
ing itself" called forth this bit of fun 
from him, in "The Last Leaf: 

"In a little district west of Washington 
Square the streets have run crazy and 
broken themselves into small strips called 
'places/ These 'places' make strange 
angles and curves. One street crosses it- 
self a time or 4 two. An artist once dis- 
covered a valuable possibility in this 
street. Suppose a collector with a bill for 
paint, paper and canvas should, in travers- 
ing this route, suddenly meet himself 
coming back, without a cent having been 
paid on account! 

"So, to quaint old Greenwich Village 
the art people soon came prowling, hunt- 
ing for north windows and eighteenth- 
century gables and Dutch attics and low 
rents." 

O. Henry himself lived a long time on 
Irving Place. He has laid the scene of 
the following stories, among others, in 
the Village: The Street With Three Ends, 
The Thing's the Play, The Unknown 
Quantity, The Furnished Room and The 
Defeat of the City. 




NOVELISTS' PARADISE 

Among the novelists who have used 
Greenwich Village for local color are: 

Henry James in Washington Square. 

S. Merwin in The Trufflers. 

Theodore Dreiser in The Genius. 

James Oppenheim in The Nine 
Tenths. 

William Dean Howells in A Hazard 
of New Fortunes. 

LeRoy Scott in No. 13 Washington 
Square. 

Robert W. Chambers in The Out- 
siders. 

David Graham Phillips in The Great 
God Success. 

Thomas Janvier in A Temporary 
Deadlock. 

F. Hopkinson Smith in Col. Carter of 
Cartersville. 

George William Curtis in Prue and I. 

Arthur Train, Owen Johnson, Edgar 
Fawcett, George Bronson Howard, F. 
Marion Crawford, Mrs. Burton Harrison, 
H. C. Bunner, Frank R. Stockton and 
many others have found in the quaintness 
of Greenwich Village material for their 
novels,

THE HOME OF CELEBRITIES 

From the days of old W outer Van 
Twiller until the present day Greenwich 
Village has been noted for the celebrities 
that have made their homes within its 
boundaries. There was, for! instance, 
Sir Peter Warren, who was something 
of a Pirate in his youth, though he did 
settle down on the Greenwich estate in his 
latest years. George Washington himself 
had his quarters in the village for a time 
during the Revolutionary War. And Vice- 
President Adams lived in a great mansion 
on Richmond Hill, which is now Mac- 
Dougal Street, where, too, Aaron Burr 
lived. 

Then there was Tom Paine, the "in- 
fidel," who lived on what is now Grove 
Street, the last few years of his life. A 
generation later Edgar Allan Poe brought 
his sad young wife to live with him in a 
house near Sixth Avenue and Waverly 
Place. Walt Whitman, Richard Watson 
Gilder, Henry James, Richard Harding 
Davis, these are names that are still 
vividly in the memory. And John Mase- 
field, perhaps England's greatest living 
poet, was once a bartender in Luke Con- 
nor's saloon, where you can go even now, 
and eat hard-boiled eggs with your glass 
of beer. 

Lafcadio Hearn lived two years on Grove 
Street before he went to Japan. 

Among the many who nurse the hope 
of becoming celebrated through the work 
they are doing in the village today, there 
are also a few notables who have already 
emerged. Theodore Dreiser, the novelist; 
James Oppenheim, the poet; John Sloan, 
the artist, are among the many who, liv- 
ing and working in Greenwich Village, 
have already tasted the sweet cup of 
success.

BOUNDARIES 

As Hypolyte Havel once put it, "Green- 
wich Village is a state of mind." It has 
no boundaries but the imagination. Bo- 
hemia is as wide as the world, and yet 
so narrow that people with the smallest 
minds cannot squeeze into its hallowed 
gates. The map which we show on an- 
other 1 page shows the boundaries of the 
old Warren farm, for the benefit of those 
who wish to be arbitrary. 



The boundaries of Greenwich Village are 
growing to embrace ever wider and wider 
areas. Recently the dramatic critic of the 
New York Times wrote: "Needless to say, 
the people of the play are artists, presum- 
ably of Greenwich Village." He was speak- 
ing of "Youth," by Miles Malleson, as 
played by the Washington Square Players, 
the scene of which is laid in England. 



News comes from the Bronx that the 
real Bohemia is now located in a little 
corner of Westchester County. A map was 
dug up, so the story goes, which shows 
that the original Greenwich Village really 
extended as far north as 263d Street As 
a result wide-awake landlords are now 
making Bronx tenements over into studios. 



Writeups of Greenwich Village have ap- 
peared, to our knowledge, in the leading 
papers of Topeka, Kan. ; Oshkosh, Wis. ; 
Pnnkin Con.ers, Ind., and Hoboken, N. J. 
The Associated Press will soon find it nec- 
essary to keep a staff correspondent on 
the spot

THE ART THEATRE 

Greenwich Village is the cradle of the 
little theater in the United States. The 
fir'st "art theater" in America was opened 
in 1831, as the Richmond Hill Theater, in 
the old mansion which had successively 
housed Vice-President Adams and Aaron 
Burr. It was located somewhere near the 
present MacDougal Street. 

Three-quarters of a century later Mac- 
Dougal Street again feels dramatic stir- 
rings, this time in the Liberal Club, where 
several irrepressible playwrights kept the 
club members amused by holding theatrical 
nights. In the course of time it became 
very evident that the public ought to see 
some of these little plays, and thus it was 
that a group who used to meet and loaf in 
the Washington Square Book Shop 
founded the Washington Square Players. 
Although this group, which has since be- 
come famous, was compelled to move up- 
town before the first performance, it was 
a product ^ of Greenwich Village, as its 
name implies. 

The migration of the Washington Square 
Players left an aching void in the village, 
which was not long afterward filled by the 
Provincetown Players, a group of artists 
and writers who had been summering to- 
gether at Provincetown, Mass. The Prov- 
incetown Players hired a house, also on 
MacDougal Street, and have devoted them- 
selves to theatrical experimentation. Theirs 
is the most productive playhouse in 
America, for they have turned out more 
new American plays than any other organi- 
zation. 

12 




THE ART THEATRE 

But there were those who believed that 
Greenwich Village ought to have its own 
more adequate theater, and so in 1917 the 
Greenwich Village Theater was built on 
Sheridan Square, rivaling in elegance any 
theater in the city. 

Now, too, we have the "Other Players" 
and the Harry Kemp Players, given over 
to individualistic interpretations. 

PERIODICALS 

Among the Village magazines which 
have sprung up from time to time only to 
die again are the Ink Pot, which lasted 
only a few issues ; Le Dernier Cri, which 
printed three numbers; Mercury, which 
was unmentionable ; Very Weak, which was 
pretty bad; The Wow, which was a joke, 
and Bruno's Greenwich Village, later called 
Bruno's Weekly, which helped to bring the 
.first slummers. 

There are, however, several that have 
stood the test of time, notably, the Pagan, 
a magazine for Eudimonists, an illustrated 
monthly review of art and literature; The 
Little Review, which came to New York 
from Chicago, devoted to Art (with a 
capital Ai) and the Intellect; The Green- 
wich Village Spectator, which is the vil- 
lage newspaper, and The Quill, a maga- 
zine of Greenwich Village, which reflects 
the spirit of the village in its illustrations, 
poetry and pfose. 

THEY DID 

They drew fat women for the Masses — 

Denuded, b.g, ungainly lasses — 

How does that help the working classes? 

— Bobby Edwards.

BOHEMIAS OF THE PAST 

The Lafayette, or, as many old-timers 
still like to call it, "The Old Martin," was, 
as John Reed has said, the real link be- 
neonate the old Village and the new, since 
it was the cradle of artistic life in New 
York. "Bohemians," he declared, "first 
gathered there as Bohemians, and the be- 
ginnings of what has become America's 
Latin Quartier and Soho there first saw 
the light of day — or rather the light of 
midnight." 

"The artists and writers came to the 
Hotel Martin to be inspired by Mr. Mar- 
tin's excellent food and drink. From the 
bachelor quarters in the nearby square — 
the Benedick and other studio houses — 
shabby, ambitious young men came in 
droves. It was to the Hotel Martin that 
the famous singers came — Jean and 
Edouard de Reszke and Pol Plancon and 
Melba; the French statesman, Jules Cam- 
bon used to come, and Maurice Gfau — then 
the manager of the Metropolitan — and 
Chartran, the celebrated painter, and the 
great Ysaye and Bartholdi. And Paulus — 
Koster and Bid's first French importation 
— to say nothing of Anna Held and San- 
dow." * 

There were earlier Bohemias, too. Men 
like Frank R. Stockton, H. C. Bunner, 
Lawrence Hutton and Edgar Fawcett used 
to forgather during the early eighties in 
the restaurant of the Grand Vatel in 
Bleecker Street, and the Taverne Alsaci- 
enne, where you could get a dinner with 
wine for thirty-five cents. Then there was 
Oscar's opposite the old Academy of De- 
sign, where wiseacres shook their heads 
and deplored the Bohemia that had gone 
out years before at Pfaff's down on Broad- 
way. 



*The Quotations are from "Greenwich 
Village," by Anna Alice Chapin. 




THE DEAR OLD VILLAGE 

So fast does time fly, and so quickly do 
times change, that I who was but yester- 
day, as it seems, the youngest newcomer to 
our Village, am now among its elders, a 
patriarch among the flock of lambs who 
frisk joyously in the sunlight of their 
newly attained Village freedom. Oh, I 
have no doubt that there are still in exist- 
ence austere relics of the antediluvian 
period before I came, ancient ones who 
look upon me, if they look at all, as a late 
intruder — who are as scornful of my claims 
to Village citizenship as I am of the pre- 
tensions of the latest generation. Never- 
theless, if I am not among the aborigines, 
[ am at least of those who came over, so 
to speak, in the Mayflower. I was among 
those present at the opening of the original 
(and how different!) Polly's restaurant on 
MacDougal Street. I helped get up the 
first Village dance ever given at Webster 
Hall. I was a Villager 1 , that is to say, in 
the time before the invasion of the bar- 
barians from Uptown, before Pepe raised 
the rents — the Golden Age. 

In those old, forgotten, far-off days, the 
Village was truly a village. Artists and 
writers lived there^ because the rents were 
low, and one could get a floor of great 
rooms with high ceilings and tall deep-em- 
brasured windows (giving a true north- 
light) for I dare not say how little money; 
because the tangle of crooked little streets 
shut out the tide of traffic, and left a quiet 
island where the houses were as it seemed 
they had always been, where the pace of 
life slowed down a bit and left time for 
dreams and friendship and art and love. 
There were two or three restaurants where 
the cuisine was good and the prices modest, 
and where one knew everyone else. Be- 
cause social life was so casual and easy, 
it was possible to spend most of one's time 
working. And the play was the play of 
artists, simple and ingenuous ; the talk was 
golden, and the loves were frank and can- 
did. — Floyd Dell in the Liberator.

THE VILLAGE EPIC 

By Bobby Edwards 

Way down South in Greenwich Village, 

There they wear no fancy frillage, 
For the ladies of the square 

All wear smocks and bob their hair. 
There they do not think it shocking 

To wear stencils for a stocking, 
That saves the laundry bills 

In Washington Square. 

Way down South in Greenwich Village, 

Where the spinsters come for thrillage, 
Where they speak of "soul relations" 

With the sordid Slavic nations, 
'Neath the guise of feminism, 

Dodging social ostracism, 
They get away with much 

In Washington Square. 

Way down South in Greenwich Village, 

Where they eat Italian swillage, 
Where the fashion illustrators 

Flirt with interior decorators, 
There the cheap Bohemian fakirs 

And the boys from Wanamaker's 
Gather "atmosphere," 

In Washington Square. 

Way down South in Greenwich Village, 

Where the brains amount to nillage, 
Where the girls are unconventional, 

And the men are unintentional, 
There the girls are self-supporting, 

There the ladies do the courting, 
The ladies buy the "eats," 

In Washington Square. 

— From the Song Book of Robert Edwards

THE VILLAGER'S LAMENT 

Alas ! Greenwich Village that was, is 
no more. Let me recount the tragic de- 
tails of its debacle. In the first place 
(doubtless the whole thing was a plot of 
the real-estate agents), the rents were 
raised. Fabulous prices were charged for 
anything with a roof over it, so that only 
a few holes and corners, desperately clung 
to, were left to the original inhabitants. 
Then, as the invaders came to stare, the 
Villagers fled from one restaurant to an- 
other, leaving each new one in rage and 
despair as it was discovered by the enemy. 
Then the show-places, with imbecile names, 
began to be opened— "picturesque" (i. e., 
insanitary) places where the Uptowners 
pay two dollars for a bad sandwich and a 
thimbleful of coffee, and look at each other 
and think they are seeing life. Ah! how 
many honest bootblack stands and coal- 
holes have been displaced to make room 
for 1 these new Coney Island sideshows ! A 
new one yawns at one's feet every day. 
Thither, allured by the hope of finding 
something truly bohemian (i. e., naughty), 
the sad Uptowner repairs, bringing his 
vulgarity, his bad manners, and his money. 
And as in a looking glass he sees himself, 
for that is all there is to see. The Village 
is not there. It still exists, as the Christian 
sect existed in the Catacombs during the 
darkest days of the Roman persecution. 
But his search for it is in vain. Let him 
go back to One Hundred and Eighty-sixth 
Street. He will never find it.— Floyd Dell 
in the Liberator. 
17 




PHASES 

"In my experience," said the writing 
man of sententious sayings, "there have 
been a dozen 'villages.' The Village 
changes are like the waves of the sea!" 

"He mentioned various phases which 
Greenwich Village had known. The studio- 
and-poverty Bohemian epoch, the labor and 
anarchy era, the futurist fad, the "free 
love" cult, the Bohemian and masquerade 
ball period, the psychoanalysis craze; the 
tea-shop epidemic, the arts-and-crafts ob- 
session, the play-acting mania; and other 
violent and more or less transient enthu- 
siasms." — Anna Alice Chapin in "Greenwich 
Village/' 



GONE ! ? ! 

BUT NOT FORGOT 

Time was when Greenwich Village 
rivalled Coney Island for the number and 
variety of its sideshows. Among the "tea- 
rooms," which in their brief day varied 
from the notorious to the innocuous, are 
the following late lamented: 

The Purple Pup, The Vermilion Hound, 
The Saraband, The Klicket, The Camou- 
flage, Don Dickerman's Pirates' Den, The 
Will-o'-the-Wisp, the Aladdin Shop, The 
Three Thieves, The Wigwam, The Open 
Door, Romany Marie's, The Jewel Box, 
The Early Bird Breakfast Room, The 
Mouse Trap, The Tea Wagon, The Roman 
Chariot, The Village Art Gallery,, etc., 
etc., etc.

OVERHEARD 

My dear, look at the man that just came 
m — the one with the long hair. Isn't he 
intrusting ? * * * Doesn't he look intel- 
lectual? What does he do? Gives dances 
at Webster Hall. * * * Oh, really! * * * 
Is it really tfue that Mr. Gallant uses hair 
restorer on his chin? * * * Are they 
married, or are they just — you know? 

* * * What is a Crump anyhow? An in- 
tellectual doughnut. * * * So many really 
wtorth-while people down here, you know. 
I think I'll open a tearoom in the Village. 

* * * Who is that with the thing sticking 
out from under his coat? Really? * * * 
Does he make them himself? * * * Does 
Mr. Freud live in the Village? I've heard 
that these psycho-what-you-callems some- 
times lose their minds altogether. * * * Is 
that man with the pointed mustache the 
one they call Polly? How does he do it? 
Rubber' cement? Really, now, I think 
you're joking. * * * Tell me about those 
revels at Webster Hall. A.;re they really 
so awful? I suppose the costumes 

* * * What's the worst thing you ever 
saw? * * * Yes. There's another Village 
guide now. But she didn't get hers pat- 
ented. * * * I'm sorry I bobbed my hair. 
It's getting to be so common. * * * Wish 
that nigger'd stop his noise. * * * This is 
not exciting. I thought Bohemia was. 

* * * The Village landlord. If you peep 
(Pepe) he'll raise your rent. * * * Harry 
had some vodka. It's glorious. Makes

THE BOOK SHOP 

Joyce Kilmer, the poet, once said: "If 
Greenwich Village is the heart of literary 
America, then the Washington Square 
Book Shop must be the soul," or some- 
thing very near that. He was referring 
to the old book shop, that was located over 
the Liberal Qub rooms, where forgathered 
that group of writers, artists and enthu- 
siasts who later formed themselves into the 
Washington Square Players. Indeed, the 
first official performance of that gifted 
company was held in the bookshop itself. 
It was the moment's inspiration of Bobby 
Jones, who has since won fame as a 
scenic artist, to put on Lord Dunsany's 
"The Glittering Gates" with impromptu 
actors and scenery. 

Since the book shop has moved to its 
present location, at 17 West 8th Street, un- 
der the Sign of the Flying Stag, it has 
become more than ever a gathering place 
for those who have to do with the writing 
rather than the reading of books. The 
startling phenomena of an author buying 
his own works has become so common at 
the W. S. B. S. as to attract no attention 
whatsoever. Books that are made and 
books in the making are the main topics 
of conversation among the members of 
this ever changing company. Of course, 
books are sold too, but they are handled 
in an atmosphere that betokens an appre- 
ciation of their contents. Lately some in- 
teresting publications have issued from the 
bookshop, -mong which the series of Fly- 
ing Stag Plays, for the Little Theatre, 
are notable.

GREENWICH VILLAGE THEATRE, 4th St.

corner of Manhattan, — so long a place of activ- 
ity in the arts — a home for the art of the 
theatre; to gather together a company of play- 
ers and craftsmen dedicated to fine endeavor; 
to give the choicest plays, ancient or modern, 
in a simple and dignified presentation, — these 
are the aims of those who have so suc- 
cessfully launched this art theatre. Phone

PROVINCETOWN PLAYERS, 139 MacDougal

THE MARIONETTE THEATRE, 49 Vandam 
St. New York's Theatrical Novelty — Remo 
Bufano, Director. 



A convenient route for those who want 
to take in the points of interest in the 
village is suggested herewith. Begin at the 
Washington Square Book Shop, on Eighth 
Street just west of Fifth Avenue, thence 
over to MacDougal Street, where there is 
a peek into MacDougal Alley, then south, 
to the Square. Cut across diagonally to 
the fountain, and then visit the shops along 
Washington Square South and Thompson 
Street. Now turn west and visit the shops 
and tea rooms on Fourth Street, crossing 
on over Sixth Avenue, until you arrive 
at Sheridan Square, which is lined with 
shops, and where the Greenwich Village 
Theatre is located. Here you will undoubt- 
edly lose yourself and will wonder how 
this can be New York, for the streets run 
in every direction but toward home. But 
no matter which way you turn, you'll find 
something interesting, so why worry?
