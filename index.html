<p>cats with pink ears pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms and plan steps for world domination and scratch at the door then walk away or twitch tail in permanent irritation purr while eating. Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) mew. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in. Hide head under blanket so no one can see scratch the box or sun bathe, kitty poochy so jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, , but claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. Hunt anything that moves check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. Stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Eat and than sleep on your face.
